PROJECT OVERVIEW:

Device driver

SUBMITTED FILES:
	
├── booga.c
├── booga.h
├── load_booga

BUILDING AND RUNNING:
	Leave files in the directory structure specified above, and type the following commands from the top level directory.

	Compile and load:
		make clean; make; ./unload_booga; ./load_booga;
		
	Run:
		./run-tests.sh

TEST PLAN:

Concurrency validation:
1. Craft a script like the run-tests.sh script.
2. Note the number of bytes that should be written or read based on the predefined number of iterations
3. Run several instance of the script concurrently.
4. Ensure that the /proc entry for the driver reports the expected values

Partial phrase validation:
1. Modify the phrases that will be printed by booga to be of equal length.
2. Provide amounts of bytes to read that are not multiples of the length of a phrase.
3. Ensure that the phrase is cut off where it is expected.

Verify termination of process attempting to write to minor 3:
1. Attempt to read the driver at minor number 3 and ensure the process is terminated.
2. Optional - Access it from a program that has a exit procedures upon receiving the SIGTERM signal and ensure that those procedures are executed.

* Ensure the value returned for the read is equal to the value that is crafted internally by the driver.
