PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project is a doubly linked non circular list that had a test class.

INCLUDED FILES:

 * TestList.c - source code
 * Job.c - source code
 * Node.c - source code
 * List.c - source code
 * TestList.h - header file
 * Job.h - header file
 * Node.h - header file
 * List.h - header file
 * Makefile - makefile
 * README - this file

BUILDING AND RUNNING:
	List:
		All project files should be in the same directory.
		From the directory containing the .c source code and header files, compile the program:
	 	$ make all 

TESTING:
	List:
		Building this list in C was pretty interesting, when I was writing the class, after creating each method and thinking through the process of how they would work I then ran the TestList.c class and stepped through each method to be assured that they were doing what they were supposed to be. Once I had finished all the methods in List.c I added the test cases to the TestList.c and realized that I needed many more checks in my methods, like to check for a one element list, checking to see if the List is unitialized and so on like that. This was a good exercise in objected oriented practices in C.

		Test cases for which my program works:
		List Size  #Tests
		1          10000
		2          10000
		3 		   10000
		10000	   10000
		20000	   10000
